The code you provided is a Rust function ~generic_walk~ that recursively walks through a tree-like
structure, where each node has children and a name. However, there are a few issues in the code that
need to be addressed:

1. The type ~Foo~ is defined but not used properly in the function.
2. The method ~children()~ is called on an instance of ~Foo~, which suggests that ~Foo~ should
implement some kind of iterator or collection for its children.
3. The parameters and return types need to be more specific to make the function clear.

Here's a revised version of your function with these issues addressed:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
struct Foo {
    name: String,
    children: Vec<Foo>,
}

impl Foo {
    fn new(name: &str) -> Foo {
        Foo {
            name: name.to_string(),
            children: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_child(&mut self, child: Foo) {
        self.children.push(child);
    }

    fn children(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Foo> {
        self.children.iter()
    }
}

fn generic_walk(name: &str, depth: i16, c: &Foo) {
    println!("{}: {:#?}", " ".repeat(depth as usize * 2), c);
    for c2 in c.children() {
        generic_walk("generic", depth + 1, c2);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut root = Foo::new("root");
    let mut child1 = Foo::new("child1");
    let mut child2 = Foo::new("child2");

    child1.add_child(Foo::new("grandchild1"));
    child2.add_child(Foo::new("grandchild2"));

    root.add_child(child1);
    root.add_child(child2);

    generic_walk("root", 0, &root);
}
#+END_SRC

*** Explanation:

1. *Struct Definition*:
   - ~Foo~ is a struct that contains a ~name~ and a vector of ~children~.

2. *Implementation*:
   - ~new~ method to create a new ~Foo~ instance.
   - ~add_child~ method to add children to a ~Foo~ instance.
   - ~children~ method returns an iterator over the children.

3. *generic_walk Function*:
   - Takes a reference to ~Foo~ (~&Foo~) to avoid moving ownership of the tree nodes.
   - Prints the name and depth of each node.
   - Recursively calls itself for each child.

4. *main Function*:
   - Constructs a sample tree structure and calls ~generic_walk~ to traverse it.

This revised version should work correctly and make more sense in a Rust context.
