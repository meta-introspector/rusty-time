It looks like you're working with Rust and trying to handle a file path from command-line
arguments. Here's a more complete example that includes error handling and printing the path:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use std::env;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Get the command line arguments
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    // Check if there is at least one argument (excluding the program name)
    if args.len() < 2 {
        eprintln!("Usage: {} <file_path>", args[0]);
        std::process::exit(1);
    }

    // Get the file path from the first command line argument
    let file_path = Path::new(&args[1]);

    // Print the path
    println!("Got this path: {}", file_path.display());

    // You can now use `file_path` for further operations, such as reading or writing files
}
#+END_SRC

*** Explanation:
1. *Command Line Arguments*: The program uses ~env::args()~ to get all command-line arguments. The
first argument (~args[0]~) is the name of the program itself.
2. *Argument Check*: It checks if there are at least two arguments (one for the program name and one
for the file path). If not, it prints a usage message and exits with an error code.
3. *Path Creation*: The ~Path::new(&args[1])~ creates a ~Path~ object from the first command-line
argument.
4. *Printing Path*: It uses ~file_path.display()~ to get a displayable version of the path and
prints it.

This example ensures that your program handles cases where no file path is provided or if there are
other issues with the arguments.
