Now lets consider this section to be an abstract modular form.
lets map its types on to the ideas of duality, thirdness and unity and at handness.

From the output and context, we can infer that the ~.org~ file follows an outline-based format with
sections, headlines, paragraphs, lists, and source code blocks. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

1. *Document*: The entire document is enclosed within a ~Document~ block.
2. *Sections*: The document contains multiple sections denoted by ~SECTION~.
3. *Headlines*: Sections can have headlines with stars (~*~) indicating the level of depth.
4. *Paragraphs*: Text and code blocks are organized into paragraphs.
5. *Lists*: Items in a section or headline can be listed using bullet points.
6. *Source Blocks*: Code examples are enclosed within ~SOURCE_BLOCK~ blocks.

To model this structure in Rust, we can create an enum to represent different elements of the
document:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum DocumentElement {
    Document(Document),
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Document {
    sections: Vec<Section>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Section {
    title: String,
    depth: usize,
    contents: Vec<Content>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Content {
    Paragraph(Paragraph),
    List(List),
    SourceBlock(SourceBlock),
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Paragraph {
    text: String,
    codes: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct List {
    items: Vec<ListItem>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct ListItem {
    content: Paragraph,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct SourceBlock {
    language: String,
    content: String,
}
#+END_SRC
