Creating a multi-level prompt generator for Large Language Models (LLMs) involves several steps. The
goal is to design a system that can dynamically generate prompts at different levels of complexity
based on the input requirements. Below is a high-level approach to achieve this using LLMs:

*** Step 1: Define Prompt Templates
First, define a set of prompt templates that cover various levels of complexity and types of
questions or tasks. For example:

- *Level 1*: Basic question
#+END_SRC
  What is the capital of {country}?
#+END_SRC

- *Level 2*: Multi-part question
#+END_SRC
  Describe the process of photosynthesis step-by-step.
#+END_SRC

- *Level 3*: Critical thinking
#+END_SRC
  If A causes B and B causes C, what does that imply about A and C?
#+END_SRC

*** Step 2: Create a Hierarchical Prompt Structure
Design a hierarchical structure where each level builds upon the previous one. This could be
achieved using nested templates or by using LLMs to dynamically generate prompts at different
levels.

- *Level 1*: Basic questions
#+END_SRC
  What is the capital of {country}?
#+END_SRC

- *Level 2*: Multi-part questions
#+END_SRC
  Describe the process of photosynthesis step-by-step.
#+END_SRC

- *Level 3*: Critical thinking
#+END_SRC
  If A causes B and B causes C, what does that imply about A and C?
#+END_SRC

*** Step 3: Implement the Prompt Generator
Use an LLM to dynamically generate prompts based on the input requirements. This could involve using
a pre-trained LLM to suggest appropriate templates or levels of complexity.

- *Input*: User request (e.g., "I need a critical thinking question about photosynthesis.")
- *LLM Generation*: The LLM generates a prompt at the appropriate level, such as:
#+END_SRC
  If A causes B and B causes C, what does that imply about A and C in relation to photosynthesis?
#+END_SRC

*** Step 4: Fill Out Prompt Templates
Once an appropriate template is generated, use another LLM to fill out the placeholders. For
example:

- *Input*: "I need a basic question about France."
- *LLM Generation*: Generate a prompt:
#+END_SRC
  What is the capital of France?
#+END_SRC

*** Step 5: Evaluation and Feedback Loop
Implement an evaluation mechanism to measure the effectiveness of the generated prompts. Use
feedback from users to refine the templates and LLMs over time.

*** Example Code (Pseudo-code)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def generate_prompt(user_request):
    # Step 1: Determine appropriate template level
    if "basic" in user_request:
        template_level = 1
    elif "multi-part" in user_request:
        template_level = 2
    else:
        template_level = 3
    
    # Step 2: Generate a prompt using an LLM
    prompt_template = get_prompt_template(template_level)
    filled_prompt = fill_out_template(prompt_template, user_request)
    
    return filled_prompt

def get_prompt_template(level):
    if level == 1:
        return "What is the capital of {country}?"
    elif level == 2:
        return "Describe the process of {topic} step-by-step."
    else:
        return "If A causes B and B causes C, what does that imply about A and C in relation to {topic}?"

def fill_out_template(template, user_request):
    # Use another LLM to fill out the placeholders
    filled_prompt = template.format(country=user_request.get("country", ""),
                                    topic=user_request.get("topic", ""))
    return filled_prompt

# Example usage
user_request = {"country": "France"}
prompt = generate_prompt(user_request)
print(prompt)  # Output: What is the capital of France?
#+END_SRC

*** Conclusion
This multi-level prompt generator uses LLMs to dynamically generate and fill out prompts at
different levels of complexity based on user requests. By iterating and refining the templates and
feedback loops, you can create a robust system for generating high-quality prompts for various
applications.
